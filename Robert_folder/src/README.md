**1 Who scored the more goals ?**

In the first part, I wanted to know which team scored the more goals at Home, Away and Overall.
The USA scored 589 goals at Home, Away itâ€™s Brazil with 396 goals and overall the team who score the more goals is Brazil with 954 goals.

To find this results, I used Pandas with `groupby` to group all home and away teams and then I use `.sum()` to take all goals. Then I used the function `max()` to know who scored the more goals.
